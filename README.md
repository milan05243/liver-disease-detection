# Liver Disease Detection

This project uses machine learning (Random Forest) to detect liver disease from patient data. It also explains predictions using SHAP (a tool to explain AI models).

## Dataset
We used the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD). It includes features like:
- Age
- Gender
- Bilirubin
- Enzyme levels
- Albumin
- And more...

## What this project does:
- Preprocesses the data
- Trains a Random Forest model
- Evaluates performance (Accuracy, F1-score, etc.)
- Uses SHAP for explainability
- Shows results using graphs

## Visuals
- Class Distribution Plot
- Feature Correlation Heatmap
- Feature Importance Graph
- SHAP Summary Plot
